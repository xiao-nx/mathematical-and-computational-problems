def count_fixed_colorings(num_colors, max_usage, cycle_structure):
    """
    Counts the number of colorings that remain fixed under a specific permutation.
    This is a combinatorial problem of assigning 'num_colors' to the 'num_cycles'
    in the permutation, while respecting the 'max_usage' constraint.

    Parameters:
    - num_colors (int): Total number of available colors.
    - max_usage (int): Max number of times a single color can be used.
    - cycle_structure (list): A list of cycle lengths in the permutation.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The number of ways to color the cycles.
