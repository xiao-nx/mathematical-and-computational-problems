Problem 1. How many ways can you color the facets of a cube if there are c=5 colors available and each color can only be used on m=2 facets or less? Note that rotated cubes represent the same coloring and only count once. Please write some code that selects for the relevant color combinations and, if possible, make it variable with respect to the two parameters, c and m.

Problem 2. Choose n random points in two dimensions. Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient. Repeat this procedure r times. What is the mathematical distribution of these correlation coefficients when r goes to infinity? Please write some code, review the result for a few numbers n, e.g. n=4,5,6, and then make a prediction for arbitrary n.
